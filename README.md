For testing you can use following credentials: </br>
For paytm wallet => mobile no - 7777777777, otp- 489871. /br>
For credit card => use any valid credit card ,no amount will be deducted as it is just test bank. </br>
For debit card => use valid debit card number, any future date for expiry and 123 as cvv. </br>
Fr online banking=> select any bank and proceed. </br>
